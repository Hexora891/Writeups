Hi, I'm Hexora! I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

This blog serves as a collection of my CTF writeups, where I document my solutions, thought processes, and lessons learned from various cybersecurity challenges. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced player seeking new perspectives, I hope these writeups prove helpful.

## What are CTFs?

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges where participants solve various puzzles, reverse engineer software, analyze network traffic, exploit vulnerabilities, and more. They're excellent ways to learn practical cybersecurity skills in a fun, competitive environment.

## Categories I Cover

- **Web Exploitation** - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities
- **Binary Exploitation** - Reverse engineering, buffer overflows, ROP chains
- **Cryptography** - Breaking ciphers, hash cracking, RSA challenges
- **Forensics** - File analysis, network packet inspection, memory dumps
- **Steganography** - Hidden data in images, audio, and other files
- **Miscellaneous** - Various other challenge types

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of the writeups or want to discuss cybersecurity topics!
